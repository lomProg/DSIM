# DSIM
This repository collect the assignments implemented during my university course of Digital Signal and Image Detection, which aim to develop and improve computer vision knowledge.

The repo is divided into 4 sub-folders, each of them contains the original `ipynb` and its `html` version and, sometimes, one or more images:
* **Assignment 1**: \

* **Assignment 2**: \
  The instructions demanded to implement a solution to be able to merge two images. It was necessary to develop three different functions to generate a stitched image of the originals.
* **Assignment 3**:
* **Assignment 4**:
